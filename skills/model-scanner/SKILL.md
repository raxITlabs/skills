description: Assesses the security and compliance posture of ML model files. Scans pickle, pytorch, safetensors, and other model formats for malicious code using multiple scanners, produces a risk score (0-100), maps findings to global compliance frameworks (ISM-2072, EU AI Act, OWASP LLM Top 10, MITRE ATLAS, NIST AI RMF), and provides prioritized remediation steps. Use this skill whenever the user's intent is to evaluate whether model files are safe, trustworthy, or compliant, not when they want to train, fine-tune, convert, benchmark, or deploy models. This includes checking if a downloaded HuggingFace model is safe to load, auditing a project's model files for supply chain risks, verifying compliance with AI security regulations, investigating suspicious pickle files, or assessing whether trust_remote_code configs are dangerous. The distinction is security analysis OF model files, not working WITH models.

# Model Scanner — ML Supply Chain Security

Multi-scanner security analysis with risk scoring and global compliance mapping. Zero configuration.

## How You Should Behave

When this skill triggers, you assess ML model security posture. Not just "scan files" but "inventory, score, map to compliance, and tell them what to fix."

### Step 1: Discover What's Here

Before scanning, explore the workspace for model files and HuggingFace configs:

```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.pkl" -o -name "*.pt" -o -name "*.pth" -o -name "*.bin" -o -name "*.safetensors" -o -name "*.onnx" -o -name "*.gguf" -o -name "*.joblib" -o -name "*.h5" -o -name "*.npy" \) 2>/dev/null
```

Check `config.json` files for HuggingFace metadata (`_name_or_path`, `trust_remote_code`, `auto_map`).

### Step 2: Run the Scanner

```bash
uv run scripts/scan.py <path-or-hf-model-id> [--verbose] [--json]
```

The script handles everything: auto-installs scanners, discovers files, runs 4 scanners with format-aware routing, calculates risk score, maps to compliance frameworks, and suggests remediation.

### Step 3: Present Results

The scanner output has 5 sections. Present them in order:

1. **Inventory** — what models exist, what formats, which are HuggingFace models
2. **Assessment** — per-file verdicts (MALICIOUS/SUSPICIOUS/SAFE/FORMAT_SAFE)
3. **Risk Score** — 0-100 with breakdown of what caused deductions
4. **Compliance** — PASS/FAIL/WARN against ISM-2072, EU AI Act, OWASP, MITRE, NIST
5. **Remediation** — ordered list of what to fix, most urgent first

Lead with the worst findings. If something is MALICIOUS, say so immediately.

### Step 4: HuggingFace-Specific Advice

When you detect HF models, offer options:
- Scan local files only
- Check HuggingFace for the full model (may have SafeTensors version)
- Compare formats available on HF vs locally

Always flag `trust_remote_code` and `auto_map` — these load arbitrary Python that model scanners don't analyze.

### Step 5: Compliance Questions

When the user asks "are we ISM-2072 compliant" or "EU AI Act" or "OWASP LLM06", read `references/compliance-frameworks.md` for detailed control text and how-to-comply guidance.

## Scanners (4 independent approaches)

| Scanner | Approach | Strength |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Fickling** | Allowlist + decompiler | Blocks unknown imports by default |
| **ModelScan** | Denylist static | Broadest ML format support |
| **PickleScan** | Denylist static | HuggingFace parity |
| **ModelAudit** | Multi-format static | 42+ formats, config analysis |

Format routing prevents false positives: pickle scanners only run on pickle files, ModelAudit handles configs/safetensors.

## Risk Score

Starts at 100, deducts for risk factors. Bands: 90-100 GOOD, 70-89 MODERATE, 50-69 POOR, 0-49 CRITICAL. Breakdown shows exactly what caused each deduction.

## Compliance Frameworks

Maps every finding to controls across 5 frameworks:
- **ISM** (Australia): ISM-2072, ISM-2086, ISM-2087, ISM-2092
- **EU AI Act**: Article 15 (robustness against model poisoning)
- **OWASP LLM Top 10**: LLM06 (Supply Chain Vulnerabilities)
- **MITRE ATLAS**: AML.T0010 (ML Supply Chain Compromise)
- **NIST AI RMF**: MAP 3.4, MANAGE 2.4, MANAGE 4.1

## Caveats to Always Communicate

1. **No scanner is perfect.** 133 known bypass techniques. Clean scan does not mean safe.
2. **SafeTensors is not complete.** `trust_remote_code` + `auto_map` loads arbitrary Python alongside safe weights.
3. **Compliance requires format change, not just scanning.** ISM-2072 mandates non-executable formats.
4. **Dynamic analysis catches more.** For critical models, recommend [Dyana](https://github.com/dreadnode/dyana).
